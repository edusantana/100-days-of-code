### Day 0: June 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: 

**Thoughts:** I have being stucked with this wheather challenge more then expected. I was trying to show the image with [CSS sprites](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_image_sprites.asp), and doing responsive design. And also testing on Chrome and Firefox. I have to finish it! Make a post about it latter.
